        <p>
            I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma looking for opportunities in the technology career field. As an MIS major, I am intrigued by the idea of optimizing and further developing the usage of databases and other technological systems in the business world.

            I have completed multiple courses with a focus on programming and database applications. I also had the opportunity to intern with the Oklahoma Securities Department. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and learning more about the possibilities in this career field.
